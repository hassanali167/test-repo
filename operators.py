# Arithmetic Operators
a, b = 10, 3
print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)
print("Modulus:", a % b)
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)
print("Floor Division:", a // b)

# Comparison Operators
print("a is greater than b:", a > b)
print("a is equal to b:", a == b)

# Logical Operators
x, y = True, False
print("AND Operator:", x and y)
print("OR Operator:", x or y)

"""
Code Explanation:
- Demonstrates arithmetic operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`.
- Shows comparison operators (`>`, `==`).
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`) are used for boolean expressions.
