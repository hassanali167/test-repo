Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.
Python provides two types of loops:
1. for loop
2. while loop

# Example of a for loop
print("For loop example:")
for i in range(5):  # Iterates from 0 to 4
    print("Iteration:", i)

# Example of a while loop
print("\nWhile loop example:")
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Iteration:", count)
    count += 1
