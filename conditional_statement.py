Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
Python provides three main conditional statements:
1. if statement
2. elif statement
3. else statement
"""

# Example of if statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

# Example of if-else statement
y = 3
if y % 2 == 0:
    print("y is even")
else:
    print("y is odd")

# Example of if-elif-else statement
z = -1
if z > 0:
    print("z is positive")
elif z < 0:
    print("z is negative")
else:
    print("z is zero")
